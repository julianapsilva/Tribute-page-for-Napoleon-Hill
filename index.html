        <h2 class="title-info"> Here's a time line of Napoleon Hill's life:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hill was born in the state of Virginia in the year 1883.</li>
          <li>At the age of 13, he began writing for his fathers' newspaper company. He used this income to get into Law school. However, his income was not sufficient, so he left.</li>
          <li>In 1908, he had the task of interviewing Andrew Carnegie, who was one of the most successful men alive at that time. This was the moment when his life changed dramatically. The interview was expected to last for three hours but it actually went on for a whole three days. Andrew suggested that Hill should put his time and effort in finding out what secret formula the successful people use in order to get to the positions they were in. Hill was also interested in finding this out, so he accepted this challenge. This lead to him carrying out many interviews with successful people at that time, including people like Henry Ford and Graham Bell.</li>
          <li>After many interviews, he discovered a secret, which he calls "the Golden Rule". The rule he described is: “Only by working harmoniously in co-operation with other individuals or groups of individuals and thus creating value and benefit for them will one create sustainable achievement for oneself.”</li>
          <li>He also found out that 98% of the population had very little or no solid beliefs in what they were capable of doing, which prevented them from attaining success. Today, his books and lectures are widely known and keep on helping people in understanding the formula for success. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Napoleon Hill quotes</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>“Whatever your mind can conceive and believe it can achieve.”</li>
          <li>“The starting point of all achievement is desire.”</li>
          <li>“Strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle.”</li>
          <li>“Think twice before you speak, because your words and influence will plant the seed of either success or failure in the mind of another.”</li>
          <li>“A goal is a dream with a deadline.”</li>
          <li>“Don’t wait. The time will never be just right.”</li>
          <li>“If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way.”</li>
          <li>“When your desires are strong enough you will appear to possess superhuman powers to achieve.”</li>
          <li>“Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit.”</li>
          <li>“It takes half your life before you discover life is a do-it-yourself project.”</li>
        </ol>
